## ðŸ–¥ About the project
Ignite Feed is a responsive React app using Vite and Typescript. It was developed as part of the fist module of Ignite by @rocketseat to practice React foundations such as state, immutability, hooks, components and how they can communicate with each other through the use of props.

It was possible to get insightful learnings to better structure the project using clean code methods and since it was developed following a prototyped design provided on Figma, it also required the practice of css skills.

To run the project locally, install the dependencies and run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
